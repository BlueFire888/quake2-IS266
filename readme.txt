In order to begin downloading this mod, make sure to have a github account, 
git-bash, Quake 2, and a link to my repository. Once this is all setup, you can download 
these files from github to your computer. From there, you can open the game.sln project file 
in an editor like Visual studio. From there, build the game project, and take the resulting 
gamex86.dll and place it into a new folder, next to the q2base folder found under Quake 2 
within steamapps. Also copy and paste the config.cfg file into this folder as well. 
After that, launch quake 2 and open the console by pressing the ‘~’ key. Type in “set game 
<name of the folder with your .dll file>” into the console, and the game should begin loading 
the mod. From there, enter a game and enjoy the epxerinece!

This mod replaces many of the weapons in quake 2 with slightly differnet versions to fit the 
RoR2 theme. These can be obtained by getting the weapons they replace normally, or through 
cheats. In addtion, many debuffs are present throughout the game that can be applied to enemies. 
Certain weapons, such as a the rocket launchers, natively inflict statuses like poison or burn. 
The other status effects, bleed and collapse, can be applied to all weapons by unlocking certain 
achivements. Doing specific actions will allow achivements to be collected. These include, 
killing oen enemy, killing 10 enemies, finding a secret, obtaining the shotgun, and 
inflitcing 3 or more statues on the same enemy. You can also pick a class at the 
beginning of the game which changes the weapons you are equiped with at the start. 
Pressing the J, K, or L keys will allow you to pick one of the classes corresponding to the 
key pressed. Pressing F1 will open up a help menu if you need help playing. Have fun!
